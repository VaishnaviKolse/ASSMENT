    <p>Dental care refers to the maintenance of oral health through the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions affecting the teeth, gums, and mouth. It encompasses a wide range of practices and procedures aimed at keeping the mouth and its components healthy and functional.

        Here's an overview of what dental care typically involves:</p><br>
        
    <p><b>Preventive Care:</b> This includes regular dental check-ups and cleanings to prevent dental issues such as cavities, gum disease, and oral infections. Preventive care also involves practices like brushing and flossing daily to maintain oral hygiene.</p><br>
    <p><b>Diagnostic Services:</b> Dentists use various diagnostic tools and techniques to assess oral health and identify any problems. This may include X-rays, oral examinations, and screenings for conditions like oral cancer.</p><br>
    <p><b>Treatment of Dental Conditions:</b> Dental care involves the treatment of various dental conditions and issues. Common treatments include fillings for cavities, root canals for infected teeth, extractions for severely damaged teeth, and gum disease treatment.</p><br>
    <p><b>Restorative Dentistry:</b> Restorative dentistry focuses on repairing or replacing damaged or missing teeth to restore function and aesthetics. This may involve procedures such as dental crowns, bridges, dental implants, and dentures.</p><br>
    <p><b>Cosmetic Dentistry:</b> Cosmetic dentistry aims to improve the appearance of the teeth and smile. It includes procedures like teeth whitening, veneers, dental bonding, and orthodontic treatment (e.g., braces or clear aligners) to correct misalignments or improve the alignment of teeth.</p><br>
    <p><b>Periodontal Care:</b> Periodontal care involves the prevention and treatment of gum disease (periodontal disease). This may include scaling and root planing (deep cleaning), gum surgery, and ongoing maintenance to manage gum health.</p><br>
    <p><b>Pediatric Dentistry:</b> Pediatric dentistry focuses on the oral health of children, including preventive care, early intervention for dental issues, and education for parents and caregivers on proper oral hygiene practices for children.</p><br>

    <header><h2>Why is Dental care important?</h2></header><br><br>
    <p>A great smile can do so many things. It can light up the room. It can win over new friends. And it can reveal a lot about your health, both inside the mouth and throughout the body. The key to keeping that great smile is taking care of your teeth. That means brushing and flossing, of course — and seeing the dentist at least every 6 months for preventive care.</p><br>
    <p>Otherwise, you could put yourself at risk of dental problems. Dentists now think there’s a link between cavities, tooth decay, gum disease and chronic health problems, including diabetes and heart disease.1  Learn about the connection and how to help safeguard your health.</p><br>
    
    <header><h2>What helps take care of your teeth</h2></header><br><br>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Find a good dentist and go every 6 months for routine care. That will help keep small cavities from turning into bigger (and more expensive) problems.</li><br>
        <li>Use a soft or extra-soft toothbrush that won’t damage tooth enamel or irritate gums. </li><br><br>
        <li>Ask the dentist to recommend a toothpaste that’s right for you. If you’re more prone to getting cavities, a toothpaste with sodium fluoride may help, recommends Dr. Hoss.</li><br><br>
        <li>Look for a mouthwash with prebiotics, such as inulin and xylitol, says Dr. Hoss. Those ingredients kill off bad bacteria and help the beneficial ones thrive. </li><br><br>
        <li>Don’t smoke. People who smoke have twice the risk of gum disease as those who don’t. And if you already have gum disease, smoking makes it harder for the gums to heal</li><br>

    </ul><br><br>
    <header><h2>How to access Dental care</h2></header><br><br>
    <p>Although it is evident that dental care access in our country encounters numerous barriers, majority of them are not rectified. A first step to any problem will be an in-depth understanding of the same, which when carried out by systematically analyzing the available literature forms the highest scientific evidence.</p><br>
    <p>Substantial legal, regulatory, and training barriers concurrently stand in the way of supporting dental providers to provide more primary health care services, medical providers to provide more oral health care services, and both groups of professionals to efficiently and effectively collaborate to improve patient care ( 80 ).</p><br>
    <p>Expanding eligibility for public coverage of dental care was linked to reductions in racial and ethnic disparities in use of dental services, according to a recent analysis.</p><br>
    <p>Despite lessened disparities, overall use of dental care remained low across racial and ethnic groups, indicating that insurance coverage is one of multiple factors that could improve access to care.</p><br>
