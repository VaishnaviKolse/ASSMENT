    <header><h2>What's Mental health?</h2></header>
    <img src="mental1.jpg" alt="Mental health care clinics Image" height="300" width="400"><br>
    <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p><br>
   <p>Mental health can affect a person’s day-to-day life, relationships, and physical health. External factors in people’s lives and relationships can also contribute to their mental well-being.
   </p><br>
   <p>Stress, depression, and anxiety can affect mental health and may disrupt a person’s routine.</p><br>
    <br><br>
    <header><h2>The WHO definition of mental health</h2></header><br><br>
    <p><b>According to the World Health Organization (WHO):</b></p><br>
    <p>“Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community.”</p><br><br>
    <p>The WHO states that mental health is “more than the absence of mental disorders.” Peak mental health is about managing active conditions and maintaining wellness and happiness.</p><br>
    <p>The organization also emphasizes that preserving and restoring mental health is important at individual, community, and societal levels.</p><br><br>

    <header><h2>Types of mental health disorders</h2></header><br><br>
    <p>Healthcare professionals group mental health disorders according to the features they have in common. They include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mood disorders</li><br>
        <li>Anxiety disorders</li><br>
        <li>schizophrenia disorders</li><br>
        <li>Panic disorders</li><br>
        <li>Obesessive Compulsive</li><br>

    </ul>
    <header><h2>Treatment</h2></header><br><br>
    <p>Various methods are available to help manage mental health conditions. Treatment is highly individual, and what works for one person may not work for another.</p><br>

    <p> Some strategies or treatments are more successful in combination with others. A person with a mental health disorder may choose different options at various stages in their life.</p><br>
        
    <p> It is important for an individual to work closely with a doctor who can help them identify their needs and provide suitable treatment.</p><br>
        
    <p>Below are some treatment options for people with mental health conditions:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Psychotherapy, or talking therapies</li><br>
        <li>Medication</li><br>
        <li>Selfhelp</li><br>
    </ul>
