    <p>You’re a complex individual with unique needs. When it comes to taking care of your health and wellness, you need a healthcare provider who can take care of you from head to toe. To stay safe and healthy today and in the future, you need access to a provider who knows and understands your health history, wellness goals, and concerns.
    </p>
    <p>Beyond just treating your aches and pains, you need a provider that offers comprehensive care that includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>disease prevention and screenings</li>
        <li>diagnosis and treatment of many types of illness</li>
        <li>education related to disease prevention or treatment</li>
        <li>injury care</li>
        <li>counseling</li>
        <li>coordination of your care</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Primary care is your first resource for healthcare. It’s about having a provider who will partner with you to help you stay healthy and able to live your best life.</p><br><br>
    <header><h2>Why is primary care important?</h2></header><br><br>
    <p>Nobody wants to feel like a number in a vast, impersonal system — especially when it comes to something as important as taking care of your health.</p>
    <p>Primary care is meant to be your main source for healthcare, one in which you have an ongoing partnership with your healthcare provider in the larger context of your community. Primary care is designed to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>give you better access to healthcare</li>
        <li>lower your costs</li>
        <li>improve your health outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many people find that primary care is a better alternative than going to the emergency room because it’s a less expensive and a less time-consuming way to treat basic, acute illnesses or injuries.</p>
    <p>According to the Council on Graduate Medical Education, people who have easy access to a primary care provider tend to spend less money on their healthcare and are healthier, too.</p>
    <header><h2>What types of services does primary care involve?</h2></header>
    <p>Your primary care provider can perform many different diagnostic services, treatments, and procedures. Here are just a few of the services they commonly provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cancer screenings</li>
        <li>cardiovascular health screenings</li>
        <li>diabetes screenings</li>
        <li>medication prescriptions</li>
        <li>immunizations</li>
        <li>minor surgical procedures like suturing wounds</li>
        <li>birth control services</li>
        <li>ultrasounds</li>
        <li>casting, splinting, and bracing</li>
        <li>wound care</li>
        <li>health counseling</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <header><h2>How to access primary care</h2></header>
    <p>In the United States, one good place to start your search for a primary care provider is with your health insurance plan, if you have one. Many plans maintain a list of primary care providers in your area.</p>
    <p>Depending on the type of insurance you have, you may save money by choosing a doctor in your plan’s network of providers.</p>
    <p>You can also talk to friends, neighbors, or colleagues in your community to find out about primary care providers they’d recommend.</p>
    <p>Additionally, online reviews might provide you with some insight into the provider’s personality, communication style, and policies.</p>
    <p>Once you have identified a primary care provider who seems like a good fit, make an appointment to see them. This will give you a chance to decide whether you could form a positive relationship with them.</p>
    <p>If you’re unhappy with the provider, don’t hesitate to find a new one. You may want to choose a different provider within the same practice. Or you could look into options that may be available to you through community clinics or other healthcare outlets.</p>
