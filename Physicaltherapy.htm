    <p>Physical therapy is a common treatment that can help you recover after an injury or surgery, or manage symptoms from a health condition that affects how you move. It’s a combination of exercises, stretches and movements that’ll increase your strength, flexibility and mobility to help you move safely and more confidently.</p><br>
    
    <p>Physical therapy is treatment that helps you improve how your body performs physical movements. It can be part of a generalized pain management plan or a specific treatment for an injury or health condition. It’s common to need physical therapy after many types of surgery, too. You might also need physical therapy to help prevent injuries before they happen.</p><br>
    <p>You’ll work with a physical therapist — a healthcare provider who’ll make sure you’re safe during your therapy.</p><br>
    <br><br>
    <header><h2>What does physical therapy treat?</h2></header><br><br>
    <p>Most people start physical therapy after a healthcare provider diagnoses an injury or condition. Examples include:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Sports injuries</li><br>
        <li>Neck pain</li><br>
        <li>Back pain</li><br>
        <li>knee pain</li><br>
        <li>Carpal tunnel syndrome</li><br>
        <li>Tendinopathy</li><br>
        <li>Spinal cord injuries</li><br>
    </ul>

    <header><h2>What are the types of physical therapy?</h2></header><br><br>
    <p>Physical therapy is a combination of hands-on techniques (a therapist moving part of your body) and exercises or movements you perform with a physical therapist’s supervision. Physical therapy can include:
    </p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Stretching</li><br>
        <li>Strength training (with or without weights or exercise equipment)</li><br>
        <li>Massage</li><br>
        <li> Heat or cold therapy</li><br>
        <li>Hydrotherapy</li><br>
        <li>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</li><br>
            
    </ul><br><br>

    <h4>Is physical therapy worth it?</h4>
    <p>It might not be easy (especially at first), but physical therapy is definitely worth it. You might feel stressed, tired or exhausted after a physical therapy session. These feelings are valid and normal. Your physical therapist will help you set realistic goals and expectations.</p><br>
    <p>Your strength, flexibility and mobility will improve over time. You might feel like physical therapy isn’t working right away. But stick with it.</p><br>
